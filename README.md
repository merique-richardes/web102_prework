## Notes

Understanding how the github works on a Mac was an ordeal, as I usually work from linux machines. 
The process of learning css selector syntax, e.g. "." vs "#" was challenging to remember at first.
Template literals were new to me, the difference between `` and '' seemed annoying at first, but I don't think I will forget it now.
